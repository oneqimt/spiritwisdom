                        An attachment-based and culturally inclusive approach that was developed by
                        Dr. Sue Johnson in the 1980â€™s.
                        This approach helps us understand attachment and boding so one can navigate
                        and find healing in relationships.
                        There has been substantial research on the effectivenss of EFT and studies
                        have found that approximately 90% of couples
                        show significant improvements. EFT is also used with individuals and
                        families.For more information on EFT you can visit:

                        A therapeutic technique that uses expressive tools and activities such as
                        guided imagery, arts and crafts,
                        role playing, music, and props with the purpose of re-enacting previous
                        emotional experiences.
                        This can be a very powerful therapeutic tool to work through trauma, grief,
                        substance abuse, and process addictions.

                        Being culturally competent as a Professional Counselor is one of my core
                        values and is something
                        that I think we must all continuously work on. As a professional, I maintain
                        my cultural competence
                        by continuing to do my own research, immersing myself in different cultural
                        experiences,
                        and being mindful of my language. With this, it is important for me to know
                        about your identities
                        and your experiences and these are conversations that I invite in our first
                        session and throughout our work together.

                <!-- Text -->
                <p>
                    Born from sludgy, slimy waters, the lotus flower is a beautiful blossom often
                    associated with purity,
                    spirituality, life, and harmony. It reminds us that even in the worst of times
                    or when we feel the most stuck,
                    we can thrive in our resiliency. People can overcome brutal circumstances and
                    end up on the other side,
                    a better version of themselves. We can lift our heads to the light that calls us
                    and make progress with dignity and calm assurance.

                <p>
                <p>The lotus flower also represents the wise and spiritually enlightened quality of
                    a person.
                    The unopened bud is representative of a folded soul that has the ability to
                    unfold and open itself up to the divine truth.
                    This unfolding is where we find our truth.
                </p></p>
                <p>
                    I picked this beautiful symbol of life as my logo because I am truly inspired by
                    the resiliency, growth, and beauty of human nature.
