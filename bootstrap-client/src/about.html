                    Hi, I'm Genevieve Miller
                </h4>
                <p class="mb-3 text-muted">
                    I am a Licensed Professional Counselor and Founder of Spirit Wisdom Counseling.
                    I am a soul counselor who is spiritually sensitive and I have spent a long time
                    trying to figure out where I fit in the world.
                    I started this practice to give strength and light to people who have always
                    felt different and have struggled to figure out why.
                    I am passionate about helping people begin to listen to their inner wisdom and
                    use their gifts as a strength.
                    Throughout my experience, I have found that people mostly want to be loved, they
                    want to be heard, and they want to be seen.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3 text-muted">
                    My areas of concentration include spirituality, substance use, and women's
                    issues.
                    I use evidenced-based practices such as emotionally-focused therapy, CBT, and
                    DBT to inform my work.
                    I also integrate intuition and a mind, body, spirit approach.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3 text-muted">
                    I am a human who has been "stuck" and who has fumbled through many of life's
                    challenges.
                    I have taken leaps of faith and been terrified, I have failed, and have
                    experienced life completely turned upside down.
                    I am human and so are you. This is where the work happens, and this is the
                    reason why I do what I do. I'm glad you're here.
