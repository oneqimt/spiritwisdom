                <p>We take precautions to protect your information.
                    When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is
                    protected both online and offline.
                </p>

                <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as personal data), that
                    information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.
                    You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking
                    for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.</p>

                <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we
                    also protect your information offline.
                    Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,
                    billing or customer service)
                    are granted access to personally identifiable information.
                    The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are
                    kept in a secure environment.</p>
